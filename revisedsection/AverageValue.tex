This topic is simple enough. The integral calculates the total area between points $a$ and $b$. The arithmetic mean (average) of anything is $\displaystyle\frac{\text{total amount of things}}{\text{total number of things}}$. In this case, the total amount of things is the total area (the integral) and the total number of things is $b-a$, so the average value of the graph of $f(x)$ is:$$\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$$
