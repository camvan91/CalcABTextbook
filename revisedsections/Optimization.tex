	Using knowledge of how maxima and minima work, it becomes easy to ``optimize'' functions. If there is a formula for something like cash input and return, you can ``optimize'' the function by finding a maximum or minimum. Given constraints, what is the maximum value of some function? Usually, you are given one function to maximize and one constraint function.\\
