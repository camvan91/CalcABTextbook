	Slope fields are (in Noah's opinion) one of the most fun things in Calculus. Given a graph, the differential equation $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}$ is solved for the $(x,y)$ coordinate. The resulting solution is the slope of the graph \textbf{should} the graph actually pass through that point. This step is repeated for a certain number of points on the graph. All the work that has to be done is plug in $(x,y)$ to the equation and draw a small line with the same slope at that point. Here's an example slope field for $y^2=C^2-x^2$(a circle with radius C):

		\def\length{sqrt(1+(x-y)^2)}

		\begin{axis}[domain=-3:3, view={0}{90}]
		\addplot3[blue, quiver={u={1/(\length)}, v={(-x/y)/(\length)}, scale arrows=0.075}, -stealth,samples=20] {0};
		\end{axis}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\newline Note: arrow heads are normally not drawn.
