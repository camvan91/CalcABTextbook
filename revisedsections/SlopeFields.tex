	Slope fields are (in Noah's opinion) one of the most fun things in Calculus. Given a graph, the differential equation $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}$ is solved for the $(x,y)$ coordinate. The resulting solution is the slope of the graph \textbf{should} the graph actually pass through that point. This step is repeated for a certain number of points on the graph. All the work that has to be done is plug in $(x,y)$ to the equation and draw a small line with the same slope at that point.\\
