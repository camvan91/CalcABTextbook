The integral finds the area underneath a graph between two points. Those two points do not necessarily have to be constants, and one can find this integral easily: $$\int_{0}^{t}\cos(x)dx$$ where $t$ is a variable. The answer is	$\sin(t)-\sin(0)=\sin(t)$. This is interesting, especially because for any point $t$ on the graph, the area underneath the curve of $\cos(x)$ between $x=0$ and $x=t$ will always be $\sin(t)$.
