	There are multiple ways to check for series convergence. Here are the ones you are required to know for AP Calculus BC:
	\subsubsection{The Root Test} The root test is the most powerful of all the tests.
	\begin{quote}
		If $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}<1$, $a_n$ converges.
	\end{quote}
	Why does this work? The $n^{th}$ root as $n\to\infty$ of some number $c>0$ will be 1, in fact, any function that grows slower than exponential growth will have an $n^{th}$ root of 1. For example, $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{1000000000n^1000000000000}$ will always be 1.
