The antiderivative is very helpful in physics problems. We already know that $x(t)$, $v(t)$, and $a(t)$ are all related through their rates (derivatives), so they must be related with their antiderivatives as well. There is no single antiderivative for a function, so instead of saying $$\int v(t) dt=x(t)$$ which is false, we can say$$\int v(t)dt=\text{change in }x(t)$$or$$\int v(t)dt=x(t)+x_0$$At any point $t$, the change in $x(t)$ will be $\int v(t) dt$. This works for all relations as well:$$\int\left(\int a(t) dt\right)dt=\int (v(t)+v_0)dt=x(t)+v_0t+x_0$$\\Notice how we do not use $C$, instead $v_0$ or $x_0$ because the constant of integration has importance. Remember that $C$ describes the $y$-intercept in a normal graph - the initial condition for a physics problem.\\
