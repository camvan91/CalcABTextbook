\par Most Calculus textbooks are long and boring with seemingly endless and sometimes meaningless examples. This text is an attempt to solve that problem with comprehensive yet concise explanations for all of the topics covered in the AP Calculus AB exam for the 2016-17 school year. As the text does not provide many examples, most of the topics are presented in an abstract way and the author recommends this text be supplementary to another textbook.\\\par All trigonometry is in radians.\\\par This textbook will have example problems throughout but exercises will be used as more of a checkpoint for the reader rather than homework.\\\par The author would like to thank his first- and second-semester Calculus teacher for teaching him the foundations of Calculus and his third-semester Calculus professor for showing him new ways to use math.
