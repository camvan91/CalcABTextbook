\par Most Calculus textbooks are long and boring with seemingly endless and sometimes meaningless examples. This text is an attempt to solve that problem with comprehensive yet concise explanations for all of the topics covered in the AP Calculus AB exam for the 2016-17 school year. As the text does not provide many examples, most of the topics are presented in an abstract way and the author recommends this text be supplementary to another textbook.
