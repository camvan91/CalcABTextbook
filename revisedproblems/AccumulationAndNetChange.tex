	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A factory's rate of output over a 10-hour day is modeled by $P(t)=\displaystyle\frac{1}{.0625t^2-.5t+2}+.5$ units in thousands. How much has the factory created between $t=2$ hours and the end of the day?
		\item A sample of Unobtanium-1050 radioactively decays over a period of time modeled by the differential equation $dr=\displaystyle\frac{-1}{4r}dt$ where $r$ is the amount of radioactive particles given off and $t$ is in decades. What percentage of the sample is still emitting radiation after 2 centuries?
