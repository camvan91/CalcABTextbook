	Using knowledge of how maxima and minima work, it becomes easy to ``optimize'' functions. If there is a formula for something like cash input and return, you can ``optimize'' the function by finding a maximum or minimum. This may be combined with the ideas behind related rates, too. Given two constraints, what is the maximum value of some function? It is simple if you use the derivative. Find the points at which the derivative of your target function is 0 and evaluate the function at those points \textbf{and} the ends of the interval you are working with.
