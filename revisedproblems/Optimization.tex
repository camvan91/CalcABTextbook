	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Minimize the surface area of a cylinder with a volume of 6 meters.
		\item Mr. Young and Dr. Bob are working on building a new rocket launcher. The maximum possible height capability of a launcher is determined by the total pressure of air passing through the outlet $a$ in psi and the diameter of the outlet $s$ in inches with the equation $\left(\displaystyle\frac{99.5\sqrt[4]{a^3}}{s}\right)+s$. Additionally, $a$ must be 175 times greater than $s$. Optimize the function to find the best (most efficient) height to aim for. Round to the nearest integer.
