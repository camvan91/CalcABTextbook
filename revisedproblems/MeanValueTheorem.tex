	The mean value theorem is relatively simple. If the reader would like to find a proof for the theorem, they are readily available on the internet.
	\begin{quotation}
		Given a closed interval [$a$,$b$], if a function $f(x)$ is always continuous, there exists a point $a\leq c\leq b$ such that the derivative at c is equal to the slope of the secant line through $a$ and $b$.
	\end{quotation}
	In other words, there exists some $c$ such that $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
