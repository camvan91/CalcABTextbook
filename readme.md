# Noah's Guide to AP Calculus AB
This is a project I put together out of frustration with my school's current textbook. This textbook that I wrote is short, concise, and somewhat abstract. The entire book (with the exception of a few XKCD comics) is all my own work. If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions in general about any math content up to Linear Algebra, feel free to contact me! My e-mail is [this](mailto:noah.stockwell@edgewoodhs.org "my e-mail") until the end of May 2016. After that, forward anything to Edgewood High School with instructions to be sent to me (Noah Stockwell):

Edgewood High School <br/>

### As of 7/31/2016, the textbook is still unfinished.
Here is a list of things in order of which I will get to them:

1. ~~Limits of Riemann Sums~~
2. ~~Rules of Integrals~~
3. ~~Average Value~~
4. Integrals Generating Functions
5. Calculating Area
6. Disc and Shell Methods
7. The Fundamental Theorem and Consequences
8. Solutions to Differential Equations
9. Accumulation and Net Change
10. Physics (using integrals)
11. Derivative-based Optimization
12. ~~u-Substitution~~
13. Trigonometric Substitution
