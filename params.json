  "body": "# Noah's Guide to AP Calculus AB\r\nThis is a project I put together to help those taking AP Calculus AB. This textbook is short, concise, and somewhat abstract. The entire book (with the exception of a few XKCD comics) is all my own work. If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions in general about any math content up to Linear Algebra, feel free to contact me! My e-mail is [this](mailto:noah.stockwell@edgewoodhs.org \"my e-mail\") until the end of May 2016. After that, forward anything to Edgewood High School with instructions to be sent to me (Noah Stockwell):\r\n\r\nEdgewood High School  \r\n2219 Monroe St.  \r\nMadison, WI 53711  \r\n(608) 257-1023\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## [Download](https://github.com/nstockwell6806/CalcABTextbook/releases/latest)  \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### More about this project:\r\nThis is written entirely in LaTeX, the source code is available at the top! If you've never heard of LaTeX, here's what it looks like:  \r\n\r\n`We can use the integral to reverse and find our original equation $f(x)$$$\\int f'(x)dx$$$$\\int 2x+5\\,dx$$$$x^2+5x+C$$to which $f(x)$ is a valid solution when $C=-1$.\\\\  `\r\n\r\nIt's not all that hard to use and it's very powerful!",
